### Doctor's schedule with PERN stack
Remake of my CS50 final project. Main difference is completely different front-end part basing on React.js instead of vanilla JavaScript. Using also PostgreSQL and Node.js with Express.js made it fully PERN stack program. The application will be constantly enriched with new features.
